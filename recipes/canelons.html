        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Catalan-style cannelloni is a typical dish in Barcelona. It is made by filling rectangular sheets of pasta with meat, fish or vegetables, rolling them up, covering them with béchamel sauce and gratinating them with cheese.</p>
        <p>Canelons are eaten all year round but the most typical occasion is Boxing Day, taking advantage of the roast meat left over from Christmas lunch. This is the basic difference between Catalan and Italian cannelloni: here they are stuffed with roast meat, while there minced meat, mixed with a sofregit of tomatoes, is added directly.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>18 cannelloni wrappers</li>
            <li>500gr veal shank</li>
            <li>250gr pork loin</li>
            <li>200gr Iberian bacon</li>
            <li>1 organic chicken</li>
            <li>100 gr foie</li>
            <li>2 carrots and 2 tomatoes peeled and cut</li>
            <li>4 onions</li>
            <li>1 leek</li>
            <li>1 garlic head</li>
            <li>50cl cognac</li>
            <li>Olive oil</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Stir pork, garlic, onion, olive oil, 1 tsp salt, and vermouth together in a Suvie pan. Insert pan into your Suvie and broil for 10 minutes, stirring halfway through cooking.</li>
            <li>While the meat cooks, prepare the bechamel. Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Sprinkle the flour over the melted butter and cook, stirring constantly, until bubbling, but not browned, about 1 minute. Slowly whisk in the milk (it may seize up a little here, but don’t worry, just keep whisking!). Bring to a boil, whisking constantly. Reduce heat to low and add nutmeg, ½ tsp salt, and ¼ tsp ground black pepper. Cook for another 3 minutes, stirring constantly until thick. Remove from heat and set aside.</li>
            <li>Mash meat with a fork until finely ground and then stir in 2 tbsp bechamel sauce. Spread ¼ cup bechamel over the bottom of a Suvie pan. Fill pasta with meat mixture and arrange in a Suvie pan. Pour remaining bechamel sauce over the canelons. Insert pan into your Suvie, input settings, and cook now or schedule.</li>
            <li>Once the canelons have finished cooking, remove the pan from your Suvie, and sprinkle the top with parmesan cheese. Serve.</li>
        </ol>
